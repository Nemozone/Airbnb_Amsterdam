## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I used Airbnb data for Oct 2020 in Amsterdam city to answer these questions:

1. In which neighborhood is it more likely to find an affordable property?
2. How are the properties priced according to their type?
3. How many properties are worthy of their price?
4. In which neighborhood are we more likely to find a high score property at a fair cost?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook inculdes all the codes used for processing, cleaning and vsualizing the data.
 you can also find the original data from airbnb here.
